## Description

This will eventually be a working reading list loosely following the Codeschool
Soup to Bits episode [Shaping Up With AngularJS](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/soup-to-bits-shaping-up-with-angular-js).

Angular setup achieved following [this guide](http://www.intridea.com/blog/2014/9/25/how-to-set-up-angular-with-rails) with some minor modifications.
